# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that I built to practice my front-end and back-end skills. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Node.js, Express, and other dependencies listed below.

# Features
- Users can compose and post tweets with a maximum length of 140 characters.

- The app displays a list of all posted tweets, sorted by their creation time in descending order.

- Users can click on the "Write a new tweet" button to toggle the visibility of the tweet composer form.

- The app uses responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository onto your local device. 
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential future enhancements for the app:

- Implement user authentication and authorization to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their own tweets.

- Add a like and retweet feature to allow users to interact with each other's tweets. 

- Implement infinite scrolling or pagination to handle large numbers of tweets.

- Add more styling and customization options to make the app more visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Conclusion

Building Tweeter was a great learning experience for me, and I am proud of what I have created. I hope that this project demonstrates my skills and passion for web development, and I look forward to continuing to improve and build upon it in the future.
